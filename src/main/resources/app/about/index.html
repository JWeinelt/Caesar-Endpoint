                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-300">My mission</h3>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-400">
                    Now, I'm working with CloudNET for, I'd say, many, years. In the past, I searched really often for a good solution to manage it with a (web) panel. Then thought 'why not make it myself?'. So, there we are: Caesar! In 2024, I already developed a version of Caesar that has been used on my Minecraft network. But that version could not be published as the most things were herd-coded.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-400">
                    My vision is to provide you a trustworthy and secure environment to manage all your servers. Either connected via CloudNET or one by one. The Caesar Server, the panel, the CaesarWorker and the websites are all available on GitHub. So you can see everything.
                    Also, Caesar is licensed under GPL v3, so you are allowed to use Caesar, as long as you don't sell it in your name.

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-300">What Caesar offers</h3>
                <ul class="mt-4 list-disc pl-6 text-lg text-gray-400">
                    <li><strong>Full transparency.</strong> The Sources of Caesar are fully open source. Plugins by third-party developers must also use the GPL v3 or MIT.</li>
                    <li><strong>One-click install of plugins.</strong> To make Caesar as user-friendly as possible, you can download and install plugins on your instance in just 1 click.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wide community support</strong> if you need any help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Premium and Enterprise Plans</strong> for developers and companies who need a personalized support via Mail, Discord or via Phone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Share your work.</strong> As a developer, you are invited to share your work on the Caesar marketplace! Users can install it directly onto their Caesar instance and give you feedback and ratings.</li>
